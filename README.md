# Google Books with MERN
*I must give credit to user AKluger, because this is copied straight from his profile until I'm capable of making meaningful alterations to the reference example. Even though I couldn't figure out much of the solution on my own, many parts of the code either seem fairly standard and without need of changing, or would require an even further level of complexity to enhance. Because of this, the only tampering I'd dare do would be cosmetic. Maybe I can attempt to convert class components into a functional form using hooks, but that will require an understanding I may not yet possess. Overall I have to greatly thank the person who created this application and also Google for listing it among the top search results for 'google books mern'. At the very least I will hope to gain a slightly better grasp of the logic needed to power this particular application so that eventually I won't feel like such a fraud for having replicated an existing product.
